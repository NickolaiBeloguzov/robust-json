## Errors module overview

This module contains all custom exceptions that can be raised during package runtime. There are a total of 5: *JSONFileError*, *JSONPathError*, *JSONStrictModeError*, *JSONObjectError*, *IncorrectFunctionParameterTypeError*. If you need to import them, it can be done like this:
```
import robust_json.errors as json_err
```
#### Exceptions:
* **JSONFileError**
    This exception indicates that there is an error with JSON file (it has an unsupported extension, cannot be processed, etc.)
* **JSONPathError**
    This exception indicates that JSON path (field0.field1.[...].fieldn) is not valid (cannot be accessed or doesn't exist in the object)
* **JSONStrictModeError**
    This exception can be raised only by *JsonFileParser.update_value()* and *JsonObjectParser.update_value()* methods because only these function support Strict Mode at the moment. This exception indicates that there is a type mismatch during update. For further information, you can see the examples of the above mentionned functions in their corresponding sections to see how this works.
* **JSONObjectError**
    This exception indicates that JSON object is not valid (has incorrect format, syntax errors, etc.)
* **IncorrectFunctionParameterTypeError**
    This exception indicates that one or more of function's parameters has incorrect type.
